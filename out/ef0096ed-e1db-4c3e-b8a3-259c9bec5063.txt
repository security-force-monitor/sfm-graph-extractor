Insurgency: Nigeria at war —GOC warns

Major General Jibrin who was addressing officers and men of the Division at a farewell and handing over ceremony emphasized the need for soldiers to remain loyal to the country and their calling and  be at alert whenever they are called up for duty.

He noted with concern that the country is at war with terrorism and other criminally-minded vices such as kidnapping, armed robbery and bunkering. According to Jibrin who is being posted to the Defence Headquarters as Chief of Army Standards and Evaluation, terrorism has now become a global problem where nobody, military or civilian, can sit unconcerned.

 “The security problem in the country is not about the military alone.  It is a national issue where everybody has a stake, but the military is the vanguard.  All over the world, it is the military that has helped to deal with terrorism in particular, and it is with the support of everybody because it is the duty of every Nigerian to ensure that this problem of terrorism is brought to an end.  We all have this important role to play in helping the military by giving information, by ensuring that they do not hide these terrorists or anybody that tries to cause problems. Most of the problems are coming from outside the country.  Most of the main terrorist groups have been sent out of the country.  The attacks are coming mainly from outside”, he said.

Major General Jibrin said while as GOC 2 Div, he was able to add value to the barracks through the support of officers and soldiers and urged them to give maximum support to his successor, Major General Emmanuel Abejirin, who promised to ensure continuity by building on the achievements recorded by his predecessor to make the Division better.
