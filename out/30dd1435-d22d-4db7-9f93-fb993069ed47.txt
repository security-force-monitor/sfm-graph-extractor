“Training is the critical element that builds and sustains professionalism as it equips the personnel with the skill and competence to perform tasks in all situations.

“It is obvious that our profession is full of risks that are difficult to circumvent and the only path to navigate these difficult paths is through continuous training.

“Hence, training has a crucial role in the attainment of professionalism,” he said.

The GOC said the competition was organised with the primary goal of improving the leadership traits of junior commanders.

He added that part of the goal was also aimed at sharpening their organisational abilitities and inculcating initiatives in the stipulated rank bracket of Lieutenant to Major.

“It is only through proper realistic training and steadfast/ethical leadership that such officers can attain their full capabilities to be combat effective.

“The leadership roles played by Majors and below, shape the quality of command and control in every unit and formation,” he said.

Earlier, the Chief of Staff, 9 Brigade, Col. Olusola Diya in his address of welcome, said that the combat proficiency competition was aimed at improving leadership qualities of junior commanders.
