Army, Navy Redeploy Senior Officers

The Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt. Gen. Kenneth Minimah, in his first major decision since assumption of office, has approved the redeployment, postings and appointments of more than 107 senior officers most of whom were recently promoted to fill the vacuum created by the retired officers in the service.

Also, the new Chief of Naval Staff (CNS), Vice Admiral Usman Jibrin, has approved the redeployment of 75 senior officers to man various commands and staff appointments.

The new Director of Army Public Relations (DAPR), Brig-Gen Olajide Laleye, at his maiden press briefing to inform members of the public about major activities within the Nigerian Army in the period under review, disclosed that the changes affected 36 Major-Generals among who are six new General Officers Commanding (GOCs), 52 Brigadier-Generals, and 19 Colonels.

He emphasised that such postings in the army were a routine exercise that is carried out from time to time to fill the existing vacancies emanating from promotion and retirement, especially with the appointment of Minimah as the new COAS.

He however warned the media and members of the public to stop heating up the polity by scrutinising the administrative decisions of the military and giving such postings and appointments ethno-religious interpretations.

He said: "Insinuations and interpretations of a purely professional, unbiased and thoroughly thought out process should not be trivialised by undue and unfounded speculations.

“Furthermore, due to the sensitive nature of postings and appointments of senior officers, it is desirable that the press refrain from releasing it (without permission) on the print and electronic media".

Laleye also assured the public that the army in collaboration with other security agencies was continuing with its counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency operations against the outlawed Boko Haram Islamic Sect.
