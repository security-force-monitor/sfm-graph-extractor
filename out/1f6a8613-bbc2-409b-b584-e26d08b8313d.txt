On the afternoon of 12 December 2015, soldiers opened fire on protesters blocking a road in the Nigerian city of Zaria. Over the following two days, more than 350 protesters and supporters of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria were killed at two sites in Zaria. Amnesty International has investigated the events of 12-14 December 2015 and visited the sites of the killings and an alleged mass grave. The findings of these investigations are presented in this report, along with recommendations to the Nigerian government and the international community.
