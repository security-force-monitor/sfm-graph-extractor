Omozoje, Commander, Guards Brigade and others.

The Director, Army Public Relations, Brig.-Gen. Olajide Laleye, who announced the release of the postings in a press briefing in Abuja on Wednesday, warned the media and the populace against misinterpreting the military postings and appointments.

Laleye, who described the postings and appointments as routine in the Army, said that it would be wrong for anybody to impute wrong meanings into the exercise.

“It is important to note that posting in the Army is a routine activity that is carried out from time to time to fill existing vacancies emanating from promotion and retirement.

“Furthermore, the Nigerian Army wishes to inform the media in particular and the public in general that posting and deployment of senior officers should not be used to overheat the polity,” he said.
