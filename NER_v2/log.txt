--- To Do:
There are two main approaches that I will try:

1. Use POS and parsing tree to extract possible name entities. It probably involves some prebuilt Libraries/Packages.
2. Train LSTM-RNN/CNN, either at word level or character level.

Issues that might be hard to cope with:
It is very likely that we recognize many name entities that we are not interested in, such as journalist's name, some governor's name, etc.

--- Observations:
1. Works poorly when the organizations's name starts with a number. E.g., 1 Mechanised Division of the Nigerian Army (Result 3.)
2. This model only have lables: PER ORG LOC MISC (MISC is for everything other than the first 3 classes). Therefore, it cannot classify titles, ranks, etc. The dataset is CONLL2003. If we switch to our dataset, it might improve.

1. Tokenization

  US training data military (not grounded in text)
  list sent by tom WHOwasincommand use only Nigeria?

4. Use a certain format for report/log, include examples under main repo, push to sfm repo

Additional data:
Two lists of units for training the model
https://github.com/security-force-monitor/nlp_starter_dataset/tree/master/other_training_data

1) from our dataset created from Department of State training report PDFs
https://github.com/security-force-monitor/nlp_starter_dataset/tree/master/other_training_data/dos/output

2) from our main research dataset
https://github.com/security-force-monitor/nlp_starter_dataset/tree/master/other_training_data/sfm/1_process_out_distinct_units/output

3) Processing code is in there too


--- Wrote:
  process.py: 1) preprocess dataset by recording info in dicts,
                    which are saved in two pickle files: dataset_labels.pickle, dataset_sentences.pickle
              2) convert SFM starter dataset to a format that can be used by the model
  pred.py: generates predictions use the trained model. Before this, run python3 train.py
  eval.py: evaluate the predctions made by model, which are generated by running pred.py

  Workflow:
    1) Prepare data
      $ python3 process.py
      $ cd SFM_STARTER
      $ python3 build_vocab.py
      $ python3 build_glove.py
      $ cd ..

    2) Train model
      $ python3 train.py

    3) Evaluate model
      $ python3 pred.py
      $ python3 eval.py

  Data used for training:
    1) 400 sentences from SFM starter dataset, but trained model often only recognize the first token of name entities of PER and ORG.
    2) In addtion to the SFM starter dataset, I added the first 5000 sentences from CONLL2003 training data

Examples: Oct_24_examples.txt

Prediction labels are mapped using this dict, define in process.py:
label_mapping = {'Person':       'PER',
                 'Rank':         'RAN',
                 'Organization': 'ORG',
                 'Title':        'TIT',
                 'Role':         'ROL'}

--- Some thoughts:
  1) I could have tried adding all CONLL2003 dataset, but given that our SFM dataset is relatively small,
     I was worried that the model might underfit on SFM dataset and only capture the features in CONLL2003.
  2) Using the additional SFM data might make the model only 'remember' all the name entities, losing the ability of generalization;
  3) Since, currently, I am only using the sentences that contain name entities, the model is likely to perform worse on the whole document.

  2. Unknown words:
      It turns out that the model handles unknown words automatically, which is implicitly done by tf.contrib.lookup.index_table_from_file (The following line is just a part of its documentation): 
      tf.contrib.lookup.index_table_from_file --- Any lookup of an out-of-vocabulary token will return a bucket ID based on its hash if num_oov_buckets is greater than zero. Otherwise it is assigned the default_value

  3. Relation extraction tools:
    > test_docs
    I have implemented a very simple relation extraction algorithm, which is simply assigning name entities to the nearest person. But this already produces some reasonable results.
    Results are included in 'test_docs', those files are in BRAT annotation format. So, the relations can be viewed in BRAT, just like the original annotations.

    Usage: $ python relation.py <text_file>


Main purpose is to get info from a lot of doc that a person cannot go through mannully.
1. corpus, with high levels and low levels, build a structure

----- Wrote:
  Split relation.py into two files: ner.py and relation_<suffix>.py
  ner.py is for producing the final result of modify NER and write the recognized name entities into a file that follows the BRAT annotation format.
  Now ner.py can split recognized entities if they contain other recognized entities. E.g., Major General Arende can be split into Major General and Arende in a7105b41-1e5c-4d6b-8920-ebad5d9e068c.txt line 9.
  relation_<suffix>.py is for relation extraction, moved to folder RE.

----- Usage:
  To run NER, use: $ python ner.py <text_file>
  The result of this script will be placed under the same folder as <text_file> but with suffix ".ann"
